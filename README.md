Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding

### Project Summary: 
The application shall pass the question onto Watson Discovery Service, which has been pre-loaded with the device’s owner manual. The project shall use the Smart Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to train it on what text in the owner’s manual is important and what is not. This will improve the answers returned from the queries.

### Project Requirements: 
The project shall use the Smart Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to train it on what text in the owner manual is important and what is not. This will improve the answers returned from the queries.

### Functional Requirements: 
Create customer care chat bot that can not only answer the basic questions such as store locations and hours, directions, making appointments but also could give the answers based on Watson Discovery service, which has been pre-loaded with the device manual.

### Software Requirements: 

(1) IBM Cloud

(2) IBM Watson

(3) Node-RED

(4) Watson Discovery Services

### Project Deliverables: 
Customer care chat bot that can not only answer the basic questions such as store locations and hours, directions, making appointments but also could give the answers based on Watson Discovery service, which has been pre-loaded with the device manual.
